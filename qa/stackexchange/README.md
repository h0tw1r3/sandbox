Everything under this path relates to my [humble contributions][1] on various [StackExchange sites][2].

"Stack Exchange is a fast-growing network of 57 question and answer sites on diverse topics from software programming to cooking to photography and gaming. We are an expert knowledge exchange: a place where physics researchers can ask each other about quantum entanglement, computer programmers can ask about JavaScript date formats, and photographers can share knowledge about taking great pictures in the snow." --[stackexchange.com/about][3]

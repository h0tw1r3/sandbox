Quickly cherry pick files from an NZB collection.   Drop an NZB file on to the page, tick off the files and click Download.  Added a little filter input thing to the top.  Remember to press enter to apply the filter.

100% client side javascript.  Test on Chrome 16.0.912.75.  Most other browsers will probably cower in fear at this bleeding edge code.

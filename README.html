<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
Feel free to browse around, and don't forget to check <a href="http://zaplabs.com/">Zaplabs.com</a>.  The idea is to scratch out some code here, and blog or write an article there.  We'll see how it goes.
</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
100% transparency.  If you can see it, you should be able to download, compile, and execute yourself.  This does not mean everything will work as you expect, that you have the capacity to make it work, or even that it will work at all.  One of these days I'll write something so anyone can upload examples and working snippets of code.
</p>
<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>
Current web environment is Apache 2.2.19 on top of Debian "unstable".  Most languages are bolted on through FastCGI.
</p>
<h3>Warranty</h3>
<p>
None, take it or leave it.  Nobody is forcing you to be here, or use anything contained in this site.  Everything here is intended as a resource for educational purposes only.
